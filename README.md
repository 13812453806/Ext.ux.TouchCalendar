The main extension is contained in the root folder of the repository and can be included in your project (along with its CSS file located within 
the resources/css folder) and will give you a basic calendar view (either showing a month or a week) that can be configured with various options.

This plugin can be added to an Ext.ux.Calendar instance to allow a store to be bound to the calendar so events can be shown in a similar style to the iPhone
does with a dot added to each day to represent the presence of an event.
